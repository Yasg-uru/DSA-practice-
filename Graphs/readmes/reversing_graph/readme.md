# **Reversing Directed Graphs: Advanced Techniques & Use Cases**

## **üìå Introduction**
Reversing a directed graph (also called **transposing a graph**) involves flipping all directed edges, i.e., if there exists an edge `u ‚Üí v` in the original graph, it is converted to `v ‚Üí u` in the reversed graph. This operation is fundamental in various advanced graph algorithms.

### **Mathematical Definition**
Given a directed graph **G = (V, E)**, its reversed graph **G' = (V, E')** is defined as:

\[ E' = \{(v, u) \mid (u, v) \in E \} \]

where every edge direction is flipped.

## **üî• When to Reverse a Graph?**
Reversing a graph is useful in several advanced algorithms. Here are some key scenarios:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Strongly Connected Components (SCC) - Kosaraju‚Äôs Algorithm**
- SCCs are groups of nodes where every node can reach every other node in the same group.
- **Why Reverse?**
  - In Kosaraju‚Äôs algorithm, we perform a **DFS on the original graph**, pushing nodes onto a stack based on finish time.
  - Then, we **reverse the graph** and process nodes in **reverse order of finish time**, which helps in identifying SCCs efficiently.

**Time Complexity:** \( O(V + E) \)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Finding All Nodes That Can Reach a Given Node**
- If we need to find all nodes that can reach a target node `T`, instead of running a **reverse DFS** on the original graph (which is tricky), we can:
  1. **Reverse the graph**
  2. **Run a DFS/BFS from node `T`** in the reversed graph
- This simplifies reachability problems significantly.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Longest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**
- The longest path in a **DAG** can be found using **topological sorting**.
- If the graph is reversed, we can process nodes **from sinks to sources**, simplifying longest path calculations.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Edge Reversal in Competitive Programming**
- Some problems require determining the number of edge reversals to make a graph strongly connected.
- **Example:** Given a graph where you can reverse edges at will, find the minimum reversals needed to make the graph strongly connected.
- **Reversing the graph helps preprocess edge dependencies efficiently.**

## **üîÑ How to Reverse a Graph Efficiently?**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Adjacency List Representation (Efficient for Sparse Graphs)**
**C++ Code:**
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> reverseGraph(const vector<vector<int>>& adjList, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> reversedAdj(n);
    for (int u = 0; u < n; u++) {
        for (int v : adjList[u]) {
            reversedAdj[v].push_back(u);
        }
    }
    return reversedAdj;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> graph = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {5}, {0}, {5}, {}, {}};
    vector<vector<int>> reversedGraph = reverseGraph(graph, 7);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < reversedGraph.size(); i++) {
        cout << i << ": ";
        for (int v : reversedGraph[i]) {
            cout << v << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Time Complexity:** \( O(V + E) \)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Adjacency Matrix Representation (Efficient for Dense Graphs)**
**C++ Code:**
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> reverseGraphMatrix(const vector<vector<int>>& adjMatrix) {
    int n = adjMatrix.size();
    vector<vector<int>> reversedMatrix(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (adjMatrix[i][j]) {
                reversedMatrix[j][i] = 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return reversedMatrix;
}
```

**Time Complexity:** \( O(V^2) \)
